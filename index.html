        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>

        <p>
          Welcome to my coding portfolio, where the only bugs you'll find are in
          the backyard! I'm not just a code monkey, I'm a code gorilla -
          swinging from branch to branch, finding the perfect solutions to your
          tech problems. My code is so clean you could eat off it, although I
          wouldn't recommend it, that would be weird. So let's team up and
          create something awesome - just don't forget to bring the coffee!

        <p>
          Cooking a new chicken recipe can be an exciting culinary adventure.
          The first step is usually to gather all the necessary ingredients,
          which might include chicken, vegetables, spices, and other seasonings.
          Then, depending on the recipe, the chicken may need to be marinated
          for a period of time, which allows the flavors to penetrate the meat
          and tenderize it.
